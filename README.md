# Financial-Models
For this project, I combined both my excitement to learn more about the power of Python's libraries and my interest for development in a quantitative financial setting.
I learned a total of 8 topics around Quantitative Modeling, and used many of Python's libraries to solve for the models and to also plot them. The first topic that I learned
was an overview of using the Quandl API to plot many financial predictive plots such as Exponential Moving averages, volatility,
and even candlestick plots using the mp1_finance library. The second topic that I learned was how to use libraries such as SciPy,
Statsmodels.api, and pulp to solve for linear systems and apply matrix algebra, which can be used for the optimization of portfolio
allocation. The third topic also uses scipy to solve for nonlinear models that are used in volatility modeling, using methods such as 
Newton's or the Bisection method to do so. The fourth topic explores that different schemes that are used for the valuation of options
by exploring trees and lattices. The fifth topic that I learned was how to model a yield curve as well was learn differen short-rate models
around pricing interest rates and derivatives. The sixth topic that I learned was analysis of Time series data, where I also used statsmodels.api to 
implement an ADF root test to determine if a stock is stationary or not. Additionally, I learned how to make a model
stationary by learning how to remove trends, seasonality, and by seasonal decomposing. The seventh topic that I learned was how to apply machine learning to create prediction
models using sklearn to plot regression models. Finally, the last topic that I learned was how to use deep learning, using different libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to build
prediction models using neural networks.
